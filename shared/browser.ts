 * announced in 2019 that it would block sign-in from Chromium EMBEDDERS — CEF
 * and Electron — as a man-in-the-middle defence, and it has never published a
 * way for one to be re-admitted. The block is on the framework, not on the
 * User-Agent: dressing Electron up as Chrome (matching `window.chrome`, the
 * Sec-CH-UA brand list and `navigator.userAgentData`) was measured against the
 * real page and still ends at "Este navegador o aplicación puede que no sean
 * seguros". Apps that genuinely needed it forked Chromium outright — Wavebox
 * left Electron for exactly this reason — and the ones that did not, such as
 * Obsidian's Web Viewer, document the limitation instead.
 *
 * So Nodus does not try. It recognises the destination BEFORE Google's wall
 * loads and offers the only thing that actually works: the system browser.
 *
 * The whole host is matched rather than a list of sign-in paths. Everything on
 * accounts.google.com is account flow — sign-in, the account chooser, the OAuth
 * authorization endpoint third-party "Continue with Google" buttons redirect to
 * — and none of it can succeed here.
