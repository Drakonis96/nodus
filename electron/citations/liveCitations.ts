// Live citation labels.
//
// A saved report is prose plus a set of claims about the corpus. The prose is the
// author's and must never change; the claims must stay true. Nodus writes every
// inline citation as `[Apellido, I. (año)](nodus://idea/g-123)`, so the visible
// label is the perishable part and the anchor is the durable one. When the corpus
// corrects a work's byline — an editor who had been miscredited as its author —
// the anchor still points at the right source while the label keeps naming the
// wrong person.
//
// This module re-derives the label from the anchor at read time. It rewrites only
// the text inside the brackets, never the anchor, never the surrounding sentence,
// and only when the stored text is one this codebase generated (see
// looksLikeGeneratedLabel). A label it cannot resolve is left exactly as it was:
// a stale name is a smaller harm than an empty citation.

 * top-ranked one, but that ranking moves — a rescan changes a confidence, a new
 * occurrence appears — and g-5293's top two works are both `principal` at
 * confidence 1.0, separated only by year. Re-deriving from the top work alone
 * turned "Moreno Garrido, A. (2004)" into "Pack, S. (2009)": not a corrected name
 * but a different source, silently substituted under a sentence written about the
 * first one.
 *
 * So the stored label is treated as evidence of which work was meant. Its year
 * must match, because a byline repair never moves a year; among the works that
 * match, the one whose byline still contains the stored surname is preferred,
 * since a miscredited editor is reordered and marked by the repair but never
 * removed. No match means no confident answer, and the citation keeps the text it
 * has: a stale name is a smaller harm than a citation pointing somewhere else.
