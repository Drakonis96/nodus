// SQL predicates for the library's status presets.
//
// These MUST agree with `deriveWorkStatus` in src/libraryStatus.ts: the row shows
// a pill and the preset filters by the same word, so a reader who clicks
// "Incompleto" must get exactly the rows whose pill says "Incompleto".
//
// The only transient state with no SQL predicate is `running`: it exists solely in
// the live queue, and the renderer overlays it. Persisted `pending` markers DO have
// a predicate, so a work waiting to resume is filterable instead of leaking into
// "Incompleto" (which is what happened while it had none).
//
// Semantic freshness is evaluated here. `idea_embedding_text_hash` is registered on
// the connection (see database.ts) from the same pure helper the embedding pipeline
// uses, so the hash SQL compares against is the one the app itself would compute.
