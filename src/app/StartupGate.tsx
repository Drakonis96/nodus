// The startup sequence: everything that can take over the whole screen before the
// app shell is allowed to render.
//
// These were seven early `return`s threaded through App.tsx's render, between the
// hooks and the shell. Each condition added over time had to be reasoned about
// against all the ones above it — `isPreviewVault`, `newInstall` and
// `whatsNewSettled` all ended up entangled that way — and nothing but reading
// order stopped two of them from being reachable at once.
//
// As an ordered list, the first guard whose predicate holds owns the screen. That
// is not a stylistic difference: showing two startup steps at once stops being
// something to check and becomes something the shape rules out.
//
// Pure movement: same predicates, same order, same components as before.
