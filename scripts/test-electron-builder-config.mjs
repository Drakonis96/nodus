// The packaging config, checked against electron-builder's OWN schema.
//
// Why this file exists: electron-builder validates its configuration against a
// strict schema whose root is `additionalProperties: false`, and it does so at
// the START of packaging. An unknown key is not ignored and does not warn — it
// aborts the run:
//
//   Invalid configuration object. electron-builder 26.15.3 has been initialized
//   using a configuration object that does not match the API schema.
//   - configuration has an unknown property '_artifactNameComment'
//
// That is a real v4.2.4 release failure, on all three platforms at once. The key
// was a documentation comment added to `build` in package.json, which is JSON and
// cannot hold a real comment. Nothing caught it locally, because `npm run build`
// is Vite and never loads this config; the only thing that reads it is a release,
// which costs three platform builds to find out.
//
// So the schema is checked here instead, from the copy electron-builder ships.
// Notes about the config belong in build/electron-builder.release.cjs, which is
// JavaScript and where a comment is free.
