//
// Enabling a skill is permission, never obligation, so a document may end with no
// figures because that is what its prose needed. It may also end with none because every
// proposal was refused — a source that is not in the block it cites, a heading, a skill
// that is not enabled, a block that already has a figure, a proposal the global selection
// left out. Both outcomes used to reach the reader as the same sentence, and neither left
// a trace. These assertions keep the two apart: the planner is handed the links it may
// cite, every refusal names its motive, and the motive is recorded where the reader and
// whoever reads the log can both find it.
